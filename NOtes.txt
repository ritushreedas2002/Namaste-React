CDN :    "CDN" stands for Content Delivery Network. CDNs are networks of distributed servers
that work together to deliver web content, such as images, stylesheets, JavaScript files, and other assets

crossorigin: 
1. Browser security rule preventing requests to different domains.
2. to request the browser to fetch such resources 
with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers. (Mechanism allowing servers to specify resource access permissions.)

NOTE: The order of the links should be maintained
-----
LINK 1: USE : Suitable for development environments with useful warnings and error messages for developers. 
It includes extra checks and debugging information.

LINK2 : USE :  Used in development environments along with React. It includes additional functionality related to 
rendering React components in the DOM.

//React.createElement=>Object=>HTML

npm install -D parcel  //-D is a flag for dev dependency
npm -package  
dependency- The dependencies object specifies the packages that you need to run your code.


dependency---1.dev dependency (in development phase)   2. normal dependency (in development phase + production phase)
^-caret (automatic minor upgrades e.g. version 2.8.3 to 2.8.4)
~-tilde (for major upgrades e.g. 2.8.3 to 3.0.0)


package.json - mainly the version of packages that the npm is handling (also the changes from minor to major) (configuration for our npm)
package-lock.json - keeps track of the exact version of all the dependencies
node modules-data base or collection of dependencies


npm install parcel (beast)
we need parcel-->parcel depends on its other dependencies-->this nesting of dependencies is known as a transitive dependency


.gitignore---blocks all those files mentioned in it from uploading into the git repo (contains all the files that I don't want to push into GitHub)

We should not put the node modules into the production (no need to upload them)
that is why package.json and package-lock.json are necessary to be uploaded (because they maintain a note of all those dependencies our project needs), as they help in regenerating the required node modules for our project
we just need to do "npm install" and it will recreate all those node modules for us

npx parcel indexReact.html --will provide a server for our app
npx - executing a package


cdn links are not a preferred way to bring React and ReactDOM into our project - as it is a network-costly operation and React version control becomes difficult
"npm install" is the same as "npm i"

Features of Parcel--
-creates a Dev Build for you
-creates a Local server for you
-does HMR = Hot Module Replacement (exchanges, adds, or removes modules while an application is running, without a full reload)
-this HMR is done by File Watching Algorithm - written in C++
-does Caching (in .parcel-cache folder)- which provides Faster Builds 
-does Image optimization
-does Minification which is essential for production build
-does Bundling
-does Compressing
-does Consistent Hashing
-does Code Splitting for you
-gives Differential Bundling to our app (so that our app runs smoothly on older browser versions as well)
-gives Diagnostics of our app
-provides good error handling (better error suggestions)
-HTTPS
-does Tree Shaking Algorithm -  analyze the import, and export of each module, and remove everything that isn't used
-different dev and prod bundles

"npx parcel indexReact.html"
when you write this, it generates a development build of your project and hosts it into port:1234 (which comes from the "dist" folder)

when we refresh the page or save files, it uses the ".parcel-cache" and "dist" folders to update the webpage using HMR

The "dist" and the ".parcel-cache" folders can be automatically generated on each build, thus they are not required to be put into GitHub

you can create a production build in the following way-
"npx parcel build indexReact.html"
//this will build a bundle(or minify), and it will put all those files into a new folder i.e. "dist" folder (that are production-ready files for the app)
//note: before writing this, from package.json delete the "main" key (else there may be a conflict)

** Local project does not directly connect with the Server
** Local pushes its code into the git (like package.json & package-lock.json is pushed and not the node-modules)
** Server then fetches the code from the git (fetches the package.json & package-lock.json to create the node-modules)
** The Server then hosts the code to the end-user
** The copy of node-modules in the Local is different from the copy of node-modules in the Server

inside package.json we configure browserslist(this tells about all the systems our app is compatible with):-
browserslist:[
    "last 2 Chrome versions",
    "last 2 Firefox versions"
] //the last 2 versions of Chrome and Firefox will definitely support our app
* "last 2 versions" - this will cover the last 2 versions of all the systems

-------------------------------------------------EPISODE 3--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

we can configure the scripts in the package.json:-
scripts are industry standards to shorten repetitive codes for starting/building our project
"scripts": {
    "start": "parcel indexReact.html",    [DEVELOPEMENT PHASE]
    "build": "parcel build indexReact.html"
  },

we can use the scripts in the terminal as follows:-
  npm run start or npm start are the same
  but npm build will not work like this, you need to write npm run build

** React.createElement => creates a ReactElement which is a JS Object => when we render this, the ReactDOM converts it into an HTMLElement and pushes it into the browser (and replaces everything from that DOM element if there was anything earlier)

 a. const parent1 = React.createElement("div", { id: "parent" },"HII")
  it isn't easy to create elements like this
  so JSX came into play -- a convention where HTML and JS are merged into one file  (JSX and React are not related to each other, e.g.- "JSX is a part of React" this statement is wrong)
** JSX is not "HTML inside Javascript"
   it is simply an "HTML-like syntax" or "XML-like syntax"
 b. const parent1 = <h1 id="parent"> HII </h1>;  //here parent1 is a React element
a. is a React element created using React, b. is a React element created using JSX (both these are the same thing)
b. is not pure JavaScript, our browser does not understand JSX
  ES6(ECMAScript) is what the JS engine understands   
  so Parcel does the whole thing that is JSX is transpiled before it reaches the JS engine (this JSX is converted into the code that our browser or the React can understand)
    but Parcel is not doing the transpilation by itself, it is putting another package called Babel (another JS library, Babel is a JS compiler) into work for this purpose
Parcel is a manager of Babel

During transpilation, internally the JSX is converted into a React.createElement done by Babel, and further methods are followed as usual

const heading=<h1 id="heading" className="hello">hii everyone</h1>; //this is not HTML, in HTML the attribute is "class", whereas that same attribute in JSX is "className"
** If you have to give an attribute in JSX, you have to write it in CamelCase, in HTML we write tabindex="1" in JSX we write tabIndex="1"
const  root=ReactDOM.createroot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(heading);

for multiline JSX code, you have to wrap it inside parentheses(), in order to help Babel understand where JSX is starting and ending
const heading=(
    <h1 id="heading" className="hello">
        hii everyone
    </h1>
);


//components   
1. Class-based components - old way (uses JS classes)
2. Functional components - new way (uses JS functions) //normal javascript function which returns some JSX element

const head1 = ()=>{
    return <h1 className="heading"> Namaste React Functional Component </h1>;
};

const head2 = ()=> <h1 className="heading"> Namaste React Functional Component </h1>;

const head3 = ()=> (
    <h1 className="heading"> Namaste React Functional Component </h1>
);
** head1, head2, head3 are the same React component

** You cannot render a functional component just like a React Element
root.render(<head1/>); //this is how to render a functional component

//Component Composition - component inside another Component
const Heading = ()=>{
    return <div id="root">
        <head1/>              // you can also write <head1></head1>  and also {head1()} -> this is like calling the head1() function
        <h1>HII EVERYONE</h1>
    </div>;
};

** You can also write normal JS functions to create functional components

const elem = <span>Hello Javascript code</span>; // consider elem as just a normal javascript variable
const heading = (
    <h1 id="heading" className="hello">
        {elem}               //This is how you can put a React Element inside another React Element
        hii everyone
    </h1>
);
const num=1000;
const data=api.getData();
const Heading = ()=>{
    return <div id="root">
        {data}                // inside these curly braces you can write any JS code/expression inside JSX
        <h2>{num}</h2>        // it will show 1000
        {heading}             // you can also put React Elements inside a functional component like this
        <h1>HII EVERYONE</h1>
    </div>;
};
* You can also put functional components inside a React element, just like a component inside another component

** Cross-site scripting is the attack technique that allows attacker to run JS code to access everything on your browser
like they can steal ur local storage data, cookies, read data
  *  JSX takes care of this injection, If the malicious API passes data to your code JSX just escapes it (sanitizing the data)

-------------------------------------------------EPISODE 4--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** For INLINE STYLING in JSX,it takes a JS object as an attribute
--------------------------------------

const stylecard={
    background-color:"yellow";
}                                   // this is a JS object

const Body = () => {
  return (
    <div className='body'>
      <div className='search'>Search</div>
      <div className='res-container' style={stylecard}>  //objects can be written within curly braces (JS code/expression are written within curly braces inside JSX)
        <RestCard />                         |
      </div>                                 |
    </div>                           //INLINE STYLING in JSX
  );
}

<div className='res-container' style={{background-color:"yellow";}}>   // writing the JS object directly
//first { } telling there is some piece of JS inside it and second { } is the JS obj itself

** Passing a Prop to a component is just like passing an argument to a function
** React wraps up all the props together and passes them as an object to the required functional component
** When you have to dynamically pass in some data to a component, you pass in as a prop
** You can pass any no. of props you wish to, React will wrap them into an object

const RestaurantCard = (props) =>{
    return (
        <div className="res-card">
            <h3>{props.resName}</h3>
            <h4>{props.cuisine}</h4>
        </div>
    );
};

const Body = () =>{
    return (
        <div className="res-container">
            <RestaurantCard resName="Meghna Foods" cuisine="Indian"/>
            <RestaurantCard resName="KFC" cuisine="Burger"/>
            <RestaurantCard resName="Tabdoor's" cuisine="Arabic"/>
        </div>
    );
};

** You can also de-structure(JS concept) the object on the fly

const RestaurantCard = ({resName,cuisine}) =>{
    return (
        <div className="res-card">
            <h3>{resName}</h3>
            <h4>{cuisine}</h4>
        </div>
    );
};

OR

const RestaurantCard = (props) =>{
    const {resName,cuisine} = props;
    return (
        <div className="res-card">
            <h3>{resName}</h3>
            <h4>{cuisine}</h4>
        </div>
    );
};

----REAL DATA is in JSON format----------

** Config-driven UI -> opens swiggy with offers available in Bengaluru, Kolkata all are different
** Config-driven UI means your UI is driven by a particular configuration based upon certain conditions
It is necessary for not building diff UI for different places

Config comes from backend
---------------JSON------------------
{
"employee": {
"name": "sonoo",
"salary": 56000,
"married": true.
}
}
-----------------------------------------

swiggy api:https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=12.9351929&lng=77.62448069999999&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING

** const {cloudinaryImageId, name, avgRating, cuisines, costForTwo, deliveryTime} = resData?.data;  // this question mark(?) is called optional chaining

** DURING USING MAP:
--------------------
we need to write a key to uniquely identify the elements:-> Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop. "key" is a reserved keyword.

                CONTAINER (root) 
     ----------------------------------                   
     |               |                |
1.component1    2.component2    3.component3
suppose you want to insert a component before component0 in the first place, this is where the key is important
key is also important as because of it, React will know which component is new, and it will not re-render everything again, otherwise, React won't know which component came at which position, and it will clean the container, and re-render everything (as it considers all the components as same)

When React renders a list of elements, it needs a way to identify each item in the list uniquely. The key prop provides 
a hint to React about the identity of each element. This is especially important when the list can dynamically change, such as 
when items are added or removed.

** Keys optimize our code heavily (big performance enhancement)

data.map((rest,index) => (
    <ResCard key={index} data={rest} />   //key is to identify each card as unique
))
//INDEX is not recommended by React itself to be used as keys

// not using keys (not acceptable) <<<< index as key <<<<<<<< unique id (best practice)

src folder-has the source code
in src folder

ALL hard coded data like links and dummy data are placed in another folder called utils

Types of EXPORT/IMPORT 
1.default (Components)
-------export default (name)
--------import (name) from './filename'

2.Named (multiple exports)
--------export const name=
--------export const name2=
--------import {name} from './filename'


Default export can be done with the named export in thsi format:---------------
// Named export
export const myFunction = () => {
  // ... function implementation
};

// Default export
const MyComponent = () => {
  // ... component implementation
};

export default MyComponent;

onClick takes a call back function 
----------
onClick{()=>{}}


REACT HOOKS  (//import from react as a named import)

NOTE:when we change a normal variable it does not affect the UI so we use the hooks
are normal js function given by react which have super powers used for DOM manipulation
these are the utility function given by react.The two imp hooks are :useState() and useEffect()

useState()-basically gives u super power react variable  keeps sync of data layer and UI layer
const [listOfRestaurants, setListOfRestaurants] = useState(reslist);
           |                     |                         |
        default            what to be placed           default value[array of objects]
                           when an event occurs

setListOfRestaurants(filteredList);
means that listOfRestaurants=filteredList; after onCLick eventListerner

this will filter out those restaurants having rating more than 4 and sets the listOfRestaurants
This is called re-rendering. When a state variable changes react re-renders its omponents. As soon as the list of restaurants updates,
 react will very quickly removes the past data and updates with the new data.

 const arr=useState(reslist);     //array destructuring//useState is returning an array
 const listOfRestaurants=arr[0];
 const setListOfRestaurants=arr[1];

  

Reconciliation Algorithm(React Fibre)
------------------------------------------

Actual DOM              Virtual DOM is the representation of the actual DOM, it is nothing but an js object
<div>
  <div>
    <h1/>
  </div>
</div>

DIFF Algorithm
-----------------

It will actually cal the difference between the previous obj and the updated obj then it actuallys  changes the DOM and
renders it at every render cycle. whenever there is a change in state variable there is a change in DOM and react re-renders.

React is fast-> because it does efficient DOM manipulation-> in Virtual DOM

--------------------------------------------------------------EPISODE 6--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Architecture---
------------------

1.MONOLITH Architecture (Suppose this is a JAVA PROJECT and we are doing everything in that project)

----------------------
| API   UI     AUTH   |  (JAVA PROJ)  (only writtern in java)
| DB     SMS          |
|---------------------|

2.MICROSERVICES

Different services for diff jobs    
---------------------------|
|                          |
|  |API|     |UI|   |DB|   |(theses services are independent of each other and interacts in some use cases)
|                          |     (ALl these small application are performed separately following separatio  of concerns (single responsibility principle))
|   |AUTH|   |SMS|         |
| ---------------- ------- |

HOW do these services interact with each other?
these services interact with each other through diff cases. They make call to diff microservices.
Our react project comes into UI  microservices. ADVANTAGE: is that UI can be writtern in react, backend can be writtern in mongodb 
so  mainly diff microservices can be writtern in different languages. They run in their own ports. eg UI:1234 , Backend:1022 and all these
ports are mapped to their domain name.  


TWO APPROACHES OF API CALL :
---------------------------------
1.
LOADS --> API CALL(takes 500ms)-->Renders it in UI
(as soon as the page loads we make an api call ,the api response and we render it )
(poor user experience as we need to wait for 500ms)

2.
LOADS --> RENDERS -->API CALL --->RE-RENDERS
(as soon as the page loads we render it then we make an api call ,the api response and we re-renders it )
(Best approach)

useEffect() hook 
-------------------------
it takes two arguments 1.callback function 2.dependency array
As teh body loads it loads the whole body as the render cycle gets over, it calls its callback function.(useEffect gets called after the component
has been rendered)

eg.
-----
useEffect(()=>{
  console.log("HII");
},[]);
 console.log("Ritu");

 console
 ----------
 Ritu
 HII

CORS: mainly our browser or local host restricts the use of another host

how to find api? : go to website ->inspect->network->click on fetch option->left side column api are given

Suppose instead of showing Loading page while the api does response and re-renders we can show shimmer UI which is basically the shadow of the whole
original UI.

const [button,setbutton]=useState("Login");
how const variable is changes?
so when we setbutton actually react ensures to find the diff between the previous vitual DOM and the modified virtual DOM and then re-renders the 
component once again, so again a new button variable is created with the modified value.

const [searchtext, setsearchtext] = useState("");
<input type='text' className='search-box' value={searchtext}></input>   
to keep track of the input we need to bind it with the local state variable .
NOTE: when at each keystroke the nothing shows in input text this is because .... the value is bind to seacrtext and the value is bind to input type
so at at change the value still remain ""

so we need to add onChange event handler :---that as the input changes we are changing the seachtext value
at each key stroke the react component gets render again and again
whenever a state variable updates,react tru=iggers a recoincilation cycle.

NOTE:
-------
const [listOfRestaurants, setListOfRestaurants] = useState([]);
const [filteredlistOfRestaurants, setfilteredListOfRestaurants] = useState([]);

we are keeping intact the main list of restaurants that is listOfRestaurants and on every change we are manipulating filteredlistOfRestaurants
so that the main list of restaurants keeps intact

--------------------------------------------------------------EPISODE 7--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
useEffect
------------
useEffect(()=>{})
1. if no dependency, then useEffect will be called at every render of the component.
2.useEffect(()=>{},[])if dependency is empty array, then useEffect will be called at first render of the component.
3.useEffect(()=>{},[btnname])if dependency is not an empty array, then useEffect will be called when the btnanme variable gets updated


useState
-----------

useState() is used to create local state variables inside your functional component
NOTE: do not create state variables inside conditional statements or for loop or functions.
------

npm react-router-dom is installed to access the router facility to enhance the multi-page concept
e.g if i write /about in url we will redirect to about us page

createBrowserRouter creates an Router configuration
--------------------- 
createBrowserRouter([{},{}]) takes a list of object where each object is given it s path and the element to be rendered at that specific path.

RouterProvider is used to provide the createBrowserRouter
----------------
import { createBrowserRouter,RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';
const appRouter=createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path:"/",
    element:<App/>
  },
  {
    path:"/about",
    element:<About/>
  }
])

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
 <RouterProvider route={appRouter}/>
);


Another approach:
-------------------

<Router>: This is a component from React Router that provides the routing context for your application. It must wrap the entire application to enable routing.

<Routes>: This component is used to define the routes for your application. Inside it, you specify the different routes using the <Route> component.

<Route path="/" element={<App />} />: This line defines a route for the root path ("/"). When the URL matches "/", it renders the <App /> component.
 The element prop is used to specify the component to render for the given route.

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
 const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <Router>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<App />} />
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    </Routes>
  </Router>
);


now suppose i want my header component to be a constant :
so 
import { createBrowserRouter,RouterProvider,Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
const AppLayout =()=>{
  return(
    <div>
      <Header/>
      <Outlet/>
    </div>
  )
}
const appRouter=createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path:"/",
    element:<AppLayout/>,
    errorElement:<Error/>
    children:[
      {
    path:"/about",
    element:<About/>,
    errorElement:<Error/>
    },
    {
    path:"/contact",
    element:<Contact/>,
    errorElement:<Error/>
    }
  ]
 }
  
])

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
 <RouterProvider route={appRouter}/>
);

now when path "/" is rendered the <AppLayout/> is rendered in place of <Outlet/>
now when path "/about" is rendered the <About> is rendered in place of <Outlet/>
so the header component remains intact and below that we add the outlet....

by clicking on about it moves to about page using <a> anchor tag it reloads the whole page which is a bad practice so we use the <link> tag
from react-router-dom. It is a wrapper of teh <a> tag

Routing
----------
1.Client Side Routing -  we are not making any sort of network call, rather we are doing changing of components as about, contact 
component already loaded in your local host.When we go to aboutus page it loads the about component

2.Server Side Routing - When the local host, makes a network call fetches the data for AboutUS page and reloads the page.

Dynamic Routing :
where fr each restaurant another page will be created
path="/restaurant/:resId" so this resId  is dynamic

useParams from react-router-dom is used to find the id of the various dynamic routing.Params is a object with the unique id
e.g-http://localhost:3000/restaurants/78511 ,useParams fetches the id :78511

which further is used for dynamic routing

Dynamic Routing:
------------------
Dynamic routing refers to the practice of generating routes dynamically based on certain parameters or data
e.g:<Route path="/user/:userId" element={<UserProfile />} /> userId keeps chaging according to individual ids.


--------------------------------------------------------------EPISODE 8------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLASS BASED Component
-------------------------

 <UserClass name="Ritushree Das" location ="Address"/>
 ALl the props u have passed will bind into a single object ...

import React from "react";
import "./User.css";
class UserClass extends React.Component{
    constructor(props){
        super(props);        and then the obj will be passed to the Component
    }

    render(){
        return <div className="User-card">
            <div>NAME :{this.props.name}</div>
            <div>Location:{this.props.location}</div>
            <div>Contact Us:@ritz.das</div>
        </div>
    }
}

export default UserClass;

----------NOTE: we can also write ------------------
class UserClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="User-card">
        <div>NAME: {this.props.name}</div>
        <div>Location: {this.props.location}</div>
        <div>Contact Us: @ritz.das</div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default UserClass;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

creating state variable is always inside constructor
---now when About.js is mounted/loaded in the web page it then goes through the jsx line by line and when it sees that the UserClass Component
is called an instance of component or the component is initialised.

LifeCycle
-----------
Parent Constructor-->Parent Render-->Child Constructor --->Child Render

componentDidMount(){
  console.log("HII MOUNT");
}

now first when UserClass is loaded the sequence of loading follows:
1.Constructor
2.render
3.componentDidMount
--------------------------------------------
now suppose if About.js is a class based component --->calling--->UserClass which is also a class Based component
Calling sequence---
1.Parent Constructor
2.Parent render
    1.UserClass is called (Child)
          1.child constructor
          2.child render
          3.child componentDidMount
3.Parent componentDidMount
------------------------------------------------
LIFECYCLE 
----------------
2PHASES:
1.render phase (is fast)
in render phase --first constructor called then render method

2.Commit phase (is slow)
after all the updation in DOM through render phase then DidMount is called
so DidMount is the place where API is called.

-------------MOUNTING CYCLE---------------
-Constructor(dummy data)
-Render (dummy data)
      <HTML dummy>
componentDidMount
      <API CALL>
      this.setstae--->state variable updated

----------UPDATING CYCLE------------
-   render(API data)
     <HTML (new api data)/>
-componentDidUpdate

----DYNMAIC BUNDLING--------
Dynamic bundling or chunking, often referred to as code splitting, is a technique used in web development to improve the performance
 and loading time of a web application. The idea is to split the JavaScript code into smaller "chunks" or "bundles" and load them on-demand, 
 instead of loading the entire JavaScript code at once. This is particularly useful for large-scale applications where the initial download size
  can be substantial.

  -----LAZY LOADING/(ON-demand Loading)----------
  Lazy loading is a technique used in web development to defer the loading of certain assets (such as images, scripts, or stylesheets) until they are
   actually needed.
   when our app loads the grocery does not loads, when we go to grocery at that point it loads
   -----Lazy() is a named export given by react
    -It takes a callback function calling import() function and inside import function taking the path of the grocery
    so making grocery having its own bundle and and the main bundle is different(app.js)
   ----Suspense------
    <Suspense fallback={<Shimmer />}><Grocery /></Suspense>
    Suspense is writtern as without it an error occurs as when our app loads it trys t load Grocery but cannot so we need to write suspense fallback 
    whick shows what to be loaded in absence of Grocery

Tailwind css works with various frameworks,normal HTML..and so on
Taiwind css usus postcss behind the scene .(Postcss is a tool for transforming js to css)

npx tailwindcss init -----it will create a taiwind.config.js
content: [
    "./src/*/.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  telling tailwind can be used in js file,jsx file ans so on
  in tailwind, everything happens related to class name

Dynamic classes in tailwing w-[200px]
  Disadvantage of taiwindcss-
  1. it makes the code look ugly
  2. it becomes messy to handle 

  Advantages--
  1.t is very light-weight 
  as if we write 10 times m-4 it jst take it as once
